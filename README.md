Output formatter for the Foxwell NT520 Pro Multi-System Scanner
===============================================================

Description
-----------
The Foxwell NT520 Pro multi-system scanner is used to collect data
from the onboard computer of an automobile. The data is exported as a
.cbf file which has undesirable formatting, so this project provides a
python script for reformatting the .cbf into the more convenient .csv
formatted file.

Usage
-----
The output-formatter.py script is available for download, and it can
berun using python 3, passing in the path of the file to convert as 
an argument.

Future Updates
--------------
-Define the repository structure  
-Refine the script, add format flexibility  
-possibly convert into a module  
-Include column headers for the .csv  
-Create a GUI graph display
